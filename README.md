## An application for planning your outfits

#### Through uploading your own pictures of your clothes from your gallery or taking a picture with the inApp Camera onto the app, you can form outfits and save them on the built in calendar. The app also contains a weather forecast function and allows you to categorise your clothes to make your planning even more detailed.
