## What is Stylophile?

Stylophile is an app which lets you upload a picture of one of your clothing items as a top, bottom or shoe. You can then mix and match your uploaded images in the app's wardrobe, which you can then save as an outfit in the app's calendar. The app also has a weather forecast, which shows the current weather, helping you plan your outfit according to weather.
 
## Plans & Ideas:

- We plan on adding a way to categorise outfits into categories like for example: casual, fancy, warm, rainy, etc. 
- Implementing an account feature, which allows the user to save outifts not only locally on the device but on an online acoount will also be considered. 
- Themes and other settings, such as notifications and account settings(if we decide on making accounts a feature) will most likely also be added. 
- The app is not available for iOS *yet*, this is also something which will be changed.
 
Please keep in mind, that it is not sure if we will implement all the plans & ideas
